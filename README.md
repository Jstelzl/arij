## Installation

No installation is required if you visit the deployed website. If you fork the repository, you will need to npm i .

## Usage

Intuitive and user friendly, Arij allows even the most scattered of us to remain organized and prioritize our time well- which is more important than ever with the holidays right around the corner! You can view all the tasks that you’ve created by completion status and priority on your page, as well as view all the tasks for the groups you have joined.
